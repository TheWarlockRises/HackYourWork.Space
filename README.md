# HackYourWork 
After so many hackathons, long work days, and study fests, we realized how common it is for people to forget to take care of themselves. From the reserach we gathered, we learned that taking small steps towards your wellbeing can significantly improve your producuitvity and performance. HackYourWork is a phone messaging system that reminds you to take the necessary health breaks while you work to give you an overall better performance and increased productivity.
